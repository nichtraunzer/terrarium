With **terrarium** we offer an immutable Developer Environment for developers working with  **[OpenDevStack](https://www.opendevstack.org/)** projects. **terrarium** provides the same environment which is used to deploy AWS or AZURE components via ODS.

By using the Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension it enables the developer to open cloud component repositories inside a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set.Â 

This repository contains an example container definition to help get you up and running with **terrarium**. The definition describes the appropriate container image and VS Code extensions that should be installed. A container configuration file (devcontainer.json) and other needed files that you can drop into any existing folder as a starting point for containerizing your project.
